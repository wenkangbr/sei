// scripts/quality-eval/persona/situations.mjs: the fixed situations the persona
// eval puts every character through. Each one is a snapshot (what the bot's
// per-turn `snapshot:` block would say) plus the dispatch the brain receives
// (event name + payload), so the run needs no Minecraft server. The snapshot
// text follows the real composer's line format (see a companion.raw.log from
// the scorecard) closely enough that the model reads it as a normal turn.
//
// `{NAME}` in a player line is replaced by the character's name, like a player
// would address them. `prime: true` (the default) means the situation happens
// mid-session: the runner first replays this character's own greeting from
// the same rep, so the greeting hint is off and the transcript has one line of
// theirs, the same as a real session a few minutes in.
