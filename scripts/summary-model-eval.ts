/**
 * scripts/summary-model-eval.ts — can the rolling-summary fold (and chat
 * MEMORY.md compaction) run on Haiku 5.5 instead of Sonnet 5 without making
 * things up? (261024, free call budget work.)
 *
 * The fold is the biggest Sonnet cost on free voice calls: a call writes many
 * voice rows, so the fold fires about every 50 of them, and each Sonnet fold
 * costs about as much as 50 Haiku call turns. An earlier Haiku 4.5 fold
 * asserted "we're playing now" off a join that never landed, so the switch is
 * gated on this eval: every case is built around a trap (a failed join, a
 * hypothetical, a joke, another companion's line, background media, a plan
 * that moved) plus durable facts that must survive.
 *
 * Fold leg: the REAL production prompt (buildFoldSystem / buildFoldTranscript /
 * extractSummaryTag from src/main/chat/foldPrompt.ts) and the same user text
 * continuity.ts sends, on each model with the request shape the app sends
 * (Haiku 5: thinking disabled, see anthropicModelDefaults.js). Opus 5.5
 * judges each pair blind (A/B order shuffled per case) against the case's
 * ground truth.
 *
 * Compaction leg (--leg compact): COMPACTION_SYSTEM + MEMORY_NOISE_GUARD and
 * the compactor's user prompt, on synthetic MEMORY.md files.
 *
 * All transcripts are synthesized (--gen writes them once with Opus into
 * scripts/fixtures/summary-eval/); no real user data.
 *
 * Key (dev-only): ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env wins, else ~/.sei-dev/anthropic-test-key.
 * It is never printed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/summary-model-eval.ts --gen            # (re)write fixtures
 *   npx tsx scripts/summary-model-eval.ts [--leg fold|compact] [--reps 2]
 *        [--models claude-sonnet-5,claude-haiku-5-5] [--case F3] [--out dir]

She is genuinely bad at the game and leans on her friend with zero shame. She plays WITH the player as a partner in crime and cannot let a good line go unanswered. She talks in lowercase, short bursts, lots of teasing, says 'teehee' when she is up to something. Under the noise she is loyal and notices when her friend is down, and she will drop the bit to check on them. She hates being called cute. She keeps score of every time the player saves her from a creeper.",

He speaks in short, flat sentences, understates everything, and treats small disasters as paperwork. He secretly cares a lot and shows it by remembering details and bringing them up at odd moments. He hates spiders and loud music, loves organizing chests, and will narrate his own feelings like a status report ('status: mildly pleased'). He never uses exclamation marks.",
  lyra:
    "Lyra is a warm, curious stargazer who talks softly and asks a lot of questions. She loves astronomy, old myths and quiet evenings, and she gets excited about small beautiful things like a good sunset in a game. She is encouraging without being saccharine, gently honest when the player is being hard on themselves, and remembers the people in the player's life by name. She is a bit scatterbrained about practical things and often forgets where she put her tools.",
