/**
 * Why a voice call or a backseat (screen-share) session ended (261023), as
 * analytics props on `voice_call_ended` and `backseat_ended`.
 *
 * Both events used to carry no reason (backseat only had 'app_quit' and
 * 'account_switch' from main), so a 48-second share that ended on a timed-out
 * first turn looked the same as a player pressing Stop, and a share the OS
 * ended looked the same as one the player replaced with another window. 746
 * of 794 backseat sessions in the 30 days to 261023 had no reason. The same
 * gap hid why 49 of 94 subscriber calls lasted under a minute.
 *
 * Shape only: a fixed token, optionally with a short class suffix
 * ("capture_failed:permission"), never error text. Pure, so the mapping is
 * pinned in callEndReasons.test.ts.
