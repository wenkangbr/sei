 * an install. A self-reported answer is the cheapest reliable attribution.

 * Shared by the renderer (the options Sui offers) and main (which turns a
 * valid answer into a person property). The values are a closed enum: main
 * never writes a person property from anything else.

   59 of 107 new installs in 261008-261011 answered "AI assistant", and we had
   no way to tell WHICH assistant, or whether a Google visit was someone
   searching the brand name after an AI answer. So those two answers get one
   optional follow-up tap. The main answer is sent the moment it is tapped
   (before the follow-up exists), so the detail is its own small event rather
   than a late property on `onboarding_attribution`, whose name and `source`
   prop stay exactly as they were for the existing dashboards. */
