 * 260607 — follow is now PERSISTENT state. The abort does NOT clear `_target`
 * anymore: an abort is almost always a player chat waking the suspended loop,
 * and clearing on it made every message cancel the follow (churn). The 1s
 * background tick below keeps trailing as long as `_target` is set, so the bot
 * stays on the owner while the model answers a chat. `_target` is cleared ONLY
 * by `unfollow` or by an explicit relocate (`goTo` and `explore`, which call
 * setFollowTarget(null) — explore added 260710 after a live run where the
 * follow tick yanked the bot straight back from every explore hop); incidental
 * actions (dig/gather/build) leave it set so the bot resumes trailing once
 * they finish. follow.js itself does not consume the signal — the registry
