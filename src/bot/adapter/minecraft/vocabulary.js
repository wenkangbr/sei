// 261013: Minecraft's own nouns for the brain's repeat note (adapter member
// gameVocabulary, brain/ownRepeats.js). A phrase she says twice that is mostly
// these words ("heading to the oak trees", "need iron ingots") is the job she
// is on, not a bit, so the note never tells her to drop it. The brain splits
// each name on "_" and matches plurals and stems, so "oak_log" covers "oak"
// and "logs".
//
// Item, block and entity names come from minecraft-data for the connected
// version, or the newest one it knows when the version is not known yet. The
// names are stable across versions, so either is fine for this.

import mcDataLib from 'minecraft-data'

// Name families whose words are not things she gathers or fights: music disc
// titles ("wait", "far"), pottery sherd and banner pattern motifs ("friend",
// "danger", "prize"), trim templates, spawn eggs (the mob is an entity name
// already) and technical blocks and entities.
