// 261021: quality pass 21.
//  - Reply turns recycled her own comeback: "rude." to "lmao thats so bad",
//    two plain lines later "rude. i'm a rock with a sword" to "ur dumb as a
//    rock". The comeback was one turn too old for the quote. A reply turn now
//    quotes her last four turns (two before); other turn kinds keep two.
//  - "actually forget the logs" while a give was running: the in_flight line
//    said the logs were "theirs now", so she let the toss finish, and the
//    mid-action choice had no case for a called-off request. The give line now
//    says stopping it keeps them, and the choice says to stop it and clear its
//    goal.
