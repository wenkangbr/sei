// 261022: MC quality pass 24.
//  - her own goals are written as hers: the setGoal description and the
//    agentic frontier block say a goal of her own leaves the player's name,
//    "we" and "together" out until the player agreed to join (first-spawn
//    goals named the player in 62 of 64 eval sessions, and the goodbye then
//    saved that goal as a shared plan)
//  - a finished mob fight says what it cost her (attack.test.js)
