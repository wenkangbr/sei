 * 261023 (quality pass 25). Her goodbyes and saved next_time steps said she
 * would "finish" goals she had never started: set on the greeting turn, then
 * an hour of talk, then "next time we finish the starter base" (pass 24 probe
 * bye_own, 6 of 8). The heartbeat she read at the goodbye listed the goal and
 * nothing about how far it got, and the next_time example said "finish the
 * roof". So a goal set this session that no world work has followed is now
 * marked as not started in the heartbeat, and the next_time text asks for
 * "start" or "try" on those. Work is any finished world action that
 * sessionEvents records as an event (quiet moves, looks and failures that
 * changed nothing are not), except fighting, eating, sleeping and using an
 * item: those happen on any goal and say nothing about this one.
 *
 * Goals from an earlier session are left unmarked: their progress then is
 * not known here.
