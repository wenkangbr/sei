/**
 * Chat-side MEMORY.md compaction (260810).
 *
 * The Minecraft bot has compacted MEMORY.md since 260703 (compactor.js, fired
 * after remember() when the file exceeds memory.compaction_trigger_bytes =
 * 8192). The chat-family surfaces (chat, voice, chess, Draw!, backseat) never
 * did: they append via the same memoryLog.js but only ever READ a 12000-byte
 * tail (readMemoryTail). So a character that is never summoned grows MEMORY.md
 * forever — old real memories fall off the visible tail while the file bloats
 * (measured: Sui at 43 KB after a week of backseat sessions, with everything
 * before Aug 7 invisible to every prompt).
 *
 * This module is the main-process trigger. It REUSES the bot's compactor
 * wholesale (createMemoryCompactor is plain ESM over node:fs + the pure
 * promptLibrary — main already imports memoryLog.js from the same directory),
 * adapting main's chat SDK (cloud-proxy vs BYOK aware, same plumbing as every
 * chat turn) to the compactor's `anthropic.call()` interface. One compactor,
 * one prompt, two surfaces.
 *
 * RACE GUARD — the bot process may be compacting the same file:
 *   - The file lock serializing MEMORY.md writers (fileLock.js) is IN-PROCESS
 *     only, so main must not compact while a bot for this character is live.
 *     isCharacterSummoned (botSupervisor, includes pending summons) gates every
 *     pass; the summon side needs no gate because the bot only compacts after
 *     its own remember() calls, which cannot happen before main's pass ends...
 *     except across the summon boundary — for that window the compactor's own
 *     lost-update guard (re-read + discard on drift before writing) bounds the
 *     damage to "this pass is discarded", never a lost entry.
 *   - Single-flight per character within main (this module's inFlight set, on
 *     top of the compactor instance's own inFlight flag).
 *
 * Failures are silent no-ops (log only) and never block a chat turn: the sole
 * caller is fire-and-forget from foldIfDue / honorRememberCalls.

/**
 * Trigger threshold, deliberately 4x the bot's 8192.
 *
 * The bot compacts at 8 KB because it reads MEMORY.md nearly whole into every
 * loop seed, so an oversized file costs every single turn. The chat surfaces
 * read only a fixed 12000-byte TAIL, so there is no per-turn urgency at all —
 * the only job here is to keep the file from growing without bound and to
 * fold weeks-old entries back into the visible tail before they are lost to
 * every prompt. Compacting late (32 KB) preserves full detail for longer,
 * spends the Sonnet call rarely, and the compactor's ~one-third target lands
 * the result (~11 KB) back inside the 12000-byte tail, so right after a pass
 * the surfaces see the character's WHOLE memory again.
