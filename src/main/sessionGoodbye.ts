/**
 * How a session's goodbye went (261008, retention fix 2(c)), as analytics
 * props on the existing `_ended` events.
 *
 * A companion that ends a session itself (game quit_game, end_call on either
 * the game brain or the chat surface) can attach a `next_time` hook to its
 * goodbye: something real to pick up next session, saved to MEMORY.md so the
 * next greeting can raise it (src/bot/brain/nextStep.js). Whether it did is
 * the one fact this module carries from that moment to the session's single
 * end choke point:
 *   - game: `closePlaySession` → `bot_session_ended.next_step_hook`;
 *   - call: the call-ended report → `voice_call_ended.next_step_hook` and
 *     `ended_by_companion`.
 *
 * Booleans only: never the hook text, never anything the companion said.
 * 261014: the note also holds the goodbye's player-facing line
 * (`next_time_for_player`) for the Home card's tag; it never reaches analytics.
 *
 * 261011: a hook set here also carries `next_step_source: 'companion'`. A
 * session the PLAYER ended can get a plan too, from a background check that
 * runs after this event has already gone out (playerEndNextStep.ts), so that
 * one is reported as its own `next_step_saved {source: 'player_end'}` event.
 *
 * The goodbye and the end event come from different processes (bot port,
 * renderer report), so a note waits here until consumed. It expires after
 * NOTE_TTL_MS so a report that never arrives (renderer reload, a quit with no
 * live world) cannot attach itself to a later session.
