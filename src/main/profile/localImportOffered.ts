/**
 * Which accounts were already offered the own-key (local profile) import on

 *
 * The offer also runs once at boot for an account that signed in on an older
 * build (it was only offered on a sign-in, so that group's local companions
 * were stranded). Recording the choice here keeps "Not now" from asking again
 * at every launch; Settings keeps a row for doing it later.
 *
 * Device-global (`<userData>/local-import-offered.json`), keyed by account id:
 * the local profile it is about belongs to the device, not to any account.
 * Holds account ids and timestamps only.
