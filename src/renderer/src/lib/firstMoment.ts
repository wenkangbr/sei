/**
 * The guided first moment (260926): pure decisions, no stores.
 *
 * When a NEW player finishes onboarding, their first stop after Sui's tour is
 * a live exchange with their companion instead of the Home screen: the chat
 * opens, the companion greets first (the normal first-meeting greeting, told
 * to end on an offer to play), and a small card under the greeting offers the
 * next step as buttons. Analytics (260926) showed 24% of new installs never
 * used any surface and none of them came back, with a median 9 minutes from
 * launch to first use.
 *
 * Kept pure so the trigger rules are unit-tested without React or IPC; the
 * state machine lives in lib/stores/useFirstMomentStore.ts and the card in
 * components/FirstMomentCard.tsx.
