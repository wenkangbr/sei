/**
 * Which companions on a call the voice director may hand a turn of its own
 * (261023, pulled out of useVoiceStore so the rule is pinned by a test).
 *
 * Two kinds of companion already have a brain driving them on the call, and a
 * director-made turn would run a second, blind one alongside it:
 *   - one in a live game session (260708): its game brain hears the call and
 *     speaks through say();
 *   - the one watching the player's screen (261023): backseat is her loop,
 *     with the screen in view. A screenless idle nudge or reaction turn made
 *     her talk over her own commentary about something unrelated to the game,
 *     and the idle nudge's end_call could hang up the call mid-share.
 * CLAUDE.md: anything that gives a companion a turn checks sharingFor first.
