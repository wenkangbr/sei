 * voice instead: the one stored as metadata.voiceShared, or (absent) the
 * close match main rolls from the character (voice:shared-default, the same
 * roll every adopter's app makes). The share step, Edit companion > Voice and
 * the character page all read the choice through these helpers, so a junk or
 * stale stored id reads as the default everywhere, exactly like main does.
